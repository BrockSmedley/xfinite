This thing does a speed test and tweets the result. To use it, you'll need to make a Twitter app and get your own access keys. See [Twitter Developers](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/basics/apps/overview.html).

## Get Started
1. Create a Twitter App and replace variables in `.env` with your own keys from Twitter.

2. Install dependencies and run...
```sh
./start.sh
./run.sh
```
